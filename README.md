# My .dotfiles for Arch Linux with i3
## [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/) using [Purepower(powerlevel10k)](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), [i3wm](https://www.i3wm.org/), [NeoVIM](https://neovim.io/)

Heavily inspired (might be taken without crediting, :C) by YouTubers like [DistroTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVls1GmFKf6WlTraIb_IaJg), [Luke Smith](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA) and from a few places on the internet I lost track of.
